# Sorting Hub

## Overview
This Java application allows users to visualize and manipulate arrays in real-time. It provides a graphical representation of the array elements as bars on the screen and enables users to adjust the array size dynamically using a slider. Additionally, the application utilizes multithreading to sort the array while simultaneously displaying the sorting process to the user. Users can choose between merge sort and selection sort algorithms for array sorting based on their preference.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of array elements as bars on the screen.
- Dynamic adjustment of array size using a slider interface.
- Multithreaded sorting for efficient array sorting while displaying the process to the user.
- Option to choose between merge sort and selection sort algorithms for array sorting.
